# guessNumber

## projectdescription


  The guessing number game, first of all the game set randomly a number, then you have 4 tries to guess that number first try ,you have to
write a random number of your choice, then if it's not correct the game gives you a hint about the range of the uknown number then if  
the input number isn't correct it gives you another hint about the parity of number , if again the number isn't correct 
it gives you another hint which is so hard and complicated, this hint gives you a result of an operation between the unknown number with another
number between 1 and 10 .This operation could be + ,-, \ , * .This is just the version 0 and I can optimize it and why not using the Tkinter module to
make a GUI application



tools :
 * the random module
 * checkint, a module I made which contains a function that forcing the user to enter an integer value
